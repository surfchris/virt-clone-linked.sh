# Script creates linked clone VM (duplicate VM with QCOW2 image backed by another QCOW2 image).
#   Two parameters required: name of base VM and name of new cloned VM

#
# Changes:
#   * VM shutdown replaced with check
#   * One or less QCOW2 image device support (check added)
#   * Start form image directory not required anymore
#   * Base VM name don't have to be the same as image name anymore
#   * Temporary file is not created anymore
#   * Minor cosmetic fixes
#
# Changes forked:
#	* Works for UEFI VM on CentOS
